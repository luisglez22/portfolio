  <p>Kháos aims to show that the universe is inherently unpredictable and that perhaps not everything has an explanation, since chaos is the natural state of everything around us, where the predictable and the unpredictable coexist.</p>
  <p>It also seeks to demonstrate through this premise that life, as we know it, is shaped by a vast chain of coincidences.</p>
  <p>It is a highly personal contemplation that takes on meaning and unfolds through a brief essay, complemented by a website that aims to visually convey the idea behind the project; an explanatory Case Study was also made.</p>
  <p>Both the drafting of the essay and its layout and design, along with the complementary website and the Brand Identity Manual, were exclusively developed by me, as it was presented as my Bachelor's Thesis.</p>

  <p>King Baudouin Memorial (Memorial Rey Balduino) located in Motril, aims to convey to the public the values and life philosophy of Baudouin, King of the Belgians, and to share with all who visit this place his human and spiritual journey.</p>
  <p>My role involved crafting its website, adhering to the previously established graphic identity in order to achieve an environment that aligns with the essence of the memorial where elegance does not compromise modernity.</p>

  <p>“Cata la Lata” is the slogan under which ANFACOCECOPESCA promotions are developed, aiming to promote the consumption of canned products and increasing knowledge about them.</p>
  <p>This work was presented at the Anfaco/Fundación Banco Sabadell Design Award, which consisted in the creation of a packaging design to be used as a case for the cans in the “Cata la Lata” campaign for one year.</p>
  <p>My proposal aims to set aside everything corporate to focus on the product itself; hence, the illustrations represent the figures of the animals themselves, achieved from paper cutouts to add an organic value that moves away from the artificial and closer to the natural and ecological.</p>

  <p>“Death Stranding” is set in a dystopian future where the world has been devastated by the “Death Stranding”, connecting human reality with that of the BTs (Beached Things) and introducing a new energy called chiralium.</p>
  <p>The credits I carried out for this game focus their aesthetics on ink stains, reminiscent of the lakes that form when a BT captures a human, composed of a black substance very similar to oil.</p>
  <p>In each scene, there is a reference to the world of “Death Stranding”: the inverted rainbow, a handprint, Sam's BB, Amélie's necklace, the cryptobiotes that Fragile always consumes, or the BTs around Higgs, as he is capable of controlling them.</p>

  <p>This project involved creating both the covers and the layout for “The Call of Cthulhu,” “Dagon,” and “The Colour Out of Space,” three tales from very different periods of the author.</p>
  <p>The cover illustrations depict the main elements of the plot, emerging through a door that, if you dare to cross and turn the page, will lead you into the aura of the story. This is made possible by a die-cut on the cover that reveals the color of the next page, creating a new composition by combining the two parts.</p>
  <p>These auras represent the atmosphere of each story through different colors that identify each tale and its cover, with the intention behind the design of making the reader's first encounter with Lovecraft's cosmic world a bit easier.</p>

  text: `
  <p>In celebration of the 50th anniversary of “A Clockwork Orange,” students from ESNE (now UDIT) and ESAD (Escola Superior de Artes e Design do Matosinhos) came together. My contribution to this project involved designing the packaging for brochures and the commemorative logo.</p>
  <p>For the brochure container, I opted for a simple exterior design, featuring only the logo, but an eyecatching interior to add value to the piece. This interior includes distinctive elements of the film's protagonist, Alex DeLarge: the hat, makeup on the right eye, eyes on the wrists, and his clothing.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the commemorative logo or seal also incorporates his iconic right eye and hat, alongside an orange (as a nod to the film title).</p>
